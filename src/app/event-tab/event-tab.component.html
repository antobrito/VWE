                <h2>Transportation</h2>
                <p>
                  Participants are responsible for arranging their own
                  transportation to and from Orlando Airport. However, to
                  facilitate ride-sharing, we have created a WhatsApp group
                  where participants can coordinate among themselves. Many
                  attendees may choose to rent cars for the duration of the
                  seminar.
                </p>

                <h2>Why In-Person Matters</h2>
                <p>
                  Attending our seminar/workshop in person significantly
                  accelerates the development of mindsight compared to online
                  sessions, which is why we no longer offer remote options. In
                  our most recent in-person seminar, 8 out of 13 participants
                  achieved full "real-time mindsight" by the 6th day. The
                  remaining participants reached the intuitive mindsight level
                  and will continue practicing to advance further.
                </p>

                  >
                </p>

                <h2>Alumni Opportunities</h2>
                <p>
                  If you wish to attend future seminars to further develop your
                  mindsight, you may join as an "alumni" at no additional
                  seminar cost. Alumni are only responsible for their meals,
                  accommodation, and transportation.
                </p>

                <h2>Post-Seminar Support</h2>
                <p>
                  After the seminar, we offer exclusive group practice and
                  support sessions for in-person attendees who wish to maintain
                  and enhance their mindsight. Once mindsight is activated,
                  online practice becomes effective. These sessions are
                  complimentary for the first month following the seminar. After
                  that, a monthly fee of $100 USD applies, covering a minimum of
                  8 sessions (2 per week). Additional sessions may be offered at
                  no extra charge, depending on Rob's schedule.
