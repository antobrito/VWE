          <p>
            Since 2017, Rob Freeman has trained with multiple instructors from around
            the world, mastering techniques that are rooted purely in science
            and psychology—without any religious or spiritual basis. His
            approach focuses on helping participants relax and “let go” of the
            controlling left brain, allowing the intuitive right brain,
            responsible for mindsight, to come forward.
          </p>

          <p>
             Through a series of engaging exercises, Rob helps to “distract” or
            “engage” the left brain, so it no longer blocks the right brain's
            incredible abilities. He often refers to the left brain as the
            “bully,” always trying to overpower the creative, intuitive “child”
            in the right brain, which is where mindsight resides. By keeping the
            “bully” occupied, the mindsight of the right brain is free to shine!
            Rob may suggest simple meditations during sessions, but how
            participants choose to relax is entirely up to them—whether it’s
            through a mantra, or imagining peaceful places like a beach, waves,
            or the laughter of children. These are all proven methods to calm
            the left brain and unleash the full potential of the right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rob also incorporates exercises designed to enhance intuition, as
            this skill goes hand in hand with mindsight. In the early stages,
            participants might sense a color like green without fully seeing it.
            But with practice, they’ll begin to perceive subtle hazes of color,
            which eventually evolve into clear symbols, numbers, letters, and
            images. The ultimate goal? To see the entire room in real-time,
            complete with movement and detail!.
          </p>
          <p>
            What Rob teaches isn't rocket science—it's a combination of common
            sense and years of experience in unlocking his own mindsight. Rob
            now offers exciting seminars and workshops designed for anyone eager
            to develop this ability, whether they have vision issues or simply
            wish to explore their potential. In a dynamic group setting,
            participants experience rapid breakthroughs, opening their mindsight
            at an accelerated pace. Check below for upcoming events and be sure
            to register early!.
