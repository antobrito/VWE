      <p>Vision Without Eyes’ approach is designed to help participants relax and “let go” of the controlling left brain, allowing the intuitive right brain—responsible for mindsight—to take the lead. By engaging in a series of exercises, participants learn to "distract" or "engage" the left brain, which can often block the right brain’s natural abilities.</p>

      <h2>UNDERSTANDING THE LEFT BRAIN AS THE “BULLY”</h2>
      <p>The left brain is often referred to as the “bully,” constantly attempting to overpower the creative, intuitive “child” of the right brain. Exercises are incorporated to keep the “bully” occupied, providing the right brain the space to activate mindsight, unlocking its full intuitive potential.</p>

      <h2>PERSONALIZED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES</h2>
      <p>Relaxation is encouraged through simple meditation techniques, though participants are free to choose how they wish to relax. Methods such as mantras, visualizing peaceful places like a beach, or recalling calming sounds like children laughing are all proven techniques that help calm the left brain and unleash the right brain’s abilities.</p>

      <p>Intuition is enhanced through a series of exercises that develop mindsight. In the early stages, participants may sense colors, like green, without fully seeing them. With practice, subtle hazes of color evolve into clear symbols, numbers, letters, and images. Ultimately, the goal is for participants to see the room in real-time, with movement and fine detail.</p>
